1. what is JSX ?

 JSX is a HTML or XML like structure
 It is a syntax extension used in React.js that allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript to create and manage user interface components more easily.
 It simplifies React development by providing a concise and readable way to describe the structure of UI elements.
 JSX code is transpiled into regular JavaScript, allowing browsers to understand and render the user interface correctly.

2. SuperPowers of JSX ?
 - HTML-like syntax for writing UI code.
 - Component composition for building reusable and modular components.
 - Embedding JavaScript expressions for dynamic content rendering.
 - Declarative approach for describing UI based on state.
 - Virtual DOM for efficient updates and improved performance.
 - IDE support for enhanced developer productivity.
 - Transpilation for compatibility with browsers 
 - support for modern JavaScript features.

3. Role of type Attribute in script tag? what options can i use there?

 The type attribute in the <script> tag is used to specify the MIME type of the script content. 
 Its role is to inform the browser about the type of script being loaded, allowing the browser to interpret and execute the script correctly.
 
 The most common options are :
 'type="text/javascript"' (default): For regular JavaScript code.

 'type="module"': For JavaScript modules using import and export statements.

 'type="text/plain"': To prevent script execution (used for code examples or documentation). 

4.{TittleComponent} vs {<TittleComponent/>} vs {<TittleComponent></TittleComponent>} in JSX

 {TittleComponent}: Renders the variable TittleComponent as a React component. This is used when the component is stored in a variable.

 {<TittleComponent/>}: Renders the TittleComponent directly as a React component. This is the standard way to render a component in JSX.

 {<TittleComponent></TittleComponent>}: Also renders the TittleComponent directly as a React component.
